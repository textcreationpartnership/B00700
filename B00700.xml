            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As though he would ſay: Becauſe I haue ſinned ſo grieuouſly, and haue committed ſuch wickedneſſe, that thou canſt not be blamed of vnrighteouſneſſe, though thou ſhouldſt puniſh me moſt rigorouſly, for I

               <p>But out of this, that <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth God to be iuſt when he iudgeth, we learne firſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.29.</note> that God (as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid) is the iuſt Iudge of the world: and albeit he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued a generall iudgement after this life,<note place="margin">God hath a particular iudgement in this world.</note> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, yet he hath a particular iudgement vpon men in this world, both elect and reprobate; <hi>iudicio non ſemper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto, ſemper tamen iuſto,</hi> not alwayes by a manifeſt, yet always by a iuſt iudgment.

                  <note place="margin">2. Sa. 12.10</note> for he ſaid, that blood ſhould not depart from his houſe, and ſo it was.

               <p>This is one of the moſt certaine markes of Gods Spirit, that as he is free in himſelfe, ſo he giueth libertie and freedome to all his children whom he poſſeſſeth.<note place="margin">Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie.</note> For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie. They are not bound with the chaines of ſin, they are not bound with mens traditions, but they freely ſerue God, as the children of the houſe are free. The Romans were free men; as citizens brag of their freemen, and there is great difference between them and other free men, that they may vſe their trades of merchandize without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo is a Chriſtian, of all men, the moſt free. Our Sauiour ſaid to <hi>Peter, Who ſhould pay tribute, children or ſtrangers?</hi>

                  </note> is a Chriſtian who brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth of the Spirit, free to do what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? God forbid; he is onely free to do Gods commandements, and to ſtand in the libertie which God hath giuen him. He is bound to keep the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:176810:79"/>to be free from the traditions and vanities of men. So a man needeth not to brag of the Spirit, that he may ſay and do what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and alwaies pretend the Spirit and the libertie purchaſed by Chriſts blood to euery one of his follies; no, but that libertie hath her owne bounds and circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for the Spirit giueth vs no more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but that which is bound by his word.</p>

But theſe two haue ſpirituall interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being ſhaddowes of things to come,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:176810:93"/>as all the Fathers confeſſe, Sion was a mountain in the holy land, which the Lord loued more then all mountaines. He might haue choſen <hi>Olimpus</hi> for height, <hi>Baſan</hi> for fatneſſe. And what was Sion, it is to be ſeene yet, there are many bigger, ſtronger, and fairer mountaines in Scotland, then was Sion. (I will compare it to <hi>Authur</hi>-ſeate, at Edinburrough) how commeth it to paſſe that the Lord chooſeth it before all mountaines? What, but becauſe he loued it, and made it a place of his habitation; there he built a Church, out of it he will let the law, yea the Goſpell came to all nations, mount Sion is a place ſo firmely fixed by Gods prouidence, that it ſhall neuer be moued. So is the Church a number indeed obſcure and baſe in compariſon of other people; but ſo ſure by his power, that the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt her, for Sion is a watch tower, <hi>ſpecula,</hi> and the watchman of Iſraell ſtandeth on the top thereof, &amp; who can take it or do it wrong, ſhe ſeemeth weake in compariſon of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mountaines, who leaped and ſcorned her, yet ſhe ſtandeth and they are all fallen: for they exalted themſelues by their pride and power, but ſhe abideth ſtrong, by the

               <p>We haue now left mount Sinai which is in Arabia where was earthquake and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and are come to mount Sion, the Church in the Goſpell, where is peace and grace. So our eſtate is better then theirs was, firmer then theirs, for God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it to be euerlaſting. What doe ye then thinke of thoſe perſecutions and nouations in the world; nothing for the Church but extremitie; her enemies are ſeeking to roote her out: but let theſe murthers of <hi>Caines</hi> ſeede, beware of themſelues, let God roote out their ſeede. Our mountaine is fixed by God, which cannot be mooued, and that little ſtone which came out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine without hands, ſhall bruiſe that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den image in peeces. Therefore let vs build our ſelues vpon mount Sion, and not on the ſand of mans inuentions, that we ſtand in the euill day, and be approued of God, reioyce therefore daughter Sion, for thy foundation is in heauen; they ſhall inuade heauen, and pull Chriſt from the right hand of his Father, before they ouerthrow thee.
